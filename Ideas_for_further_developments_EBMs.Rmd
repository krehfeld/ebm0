## EBMs

+ The heat capacity determines the response time/relaxation time of the system --> it should be obtained from data, e.g. from unforced/steady state model runs or from 4xCO2 experiments
+ An extension would be to consider 2-3 boxes in the EBM, with different response times (e.g. Rypdal & Fredriksen)
+ TOA noise level - is this something we can estimate from data?
+ extend to 1d EBMs (Sellers-type, should be straightforward with deSolve which can handle up to 3d)
